### Hey 👋🏽, I'm [Hees, 栾合密!]


<br />

Hi, I'm  Hees, a Researcher 🚀 from China, currently, my interests are methodology development of mass spectrometry, pharmaco-metabolomics, and drugs/metabolites metabolism and their targets discovery. We develop a large-scale, high-throughput, non-targeted mass spectrometry based pharmaco-metabolomics methodology system, as well as specific analytical methods for targeting the gut flora related drugs/metabolites. Integration of mass spectrometry, pharmaco-metabolomics, and bioinformatics technologies seeks to study the drug/metabolite-driven pathophysiological metabolism, and discover the functional biomarkers and pharmacotherapeutic targets associated with chronic complex disorder.

**Personal Stuffs:**

- 👨🏽‍💻 I’m currently working on mass specroemtry and metabolomics;
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on data quality control of Omics 🤝;
- 💬 Ask me about anything, I am happy to help;
- ⚡️ We have developed 3 tools, CPVA, statTarget and metaboDB
